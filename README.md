# vim-Freshfox

vim-Freshfox is a Vim plugin that automates page reloading with Firefox.

Originally, it was ment to be used with vimtex since the pluging can't refresh the pdf if it is rendered with firefox.
But vim-Freshfox can be used without vimtex just by calling th refresh function of the module.

(it also work with firefox dev)
